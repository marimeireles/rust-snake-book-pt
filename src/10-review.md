# What happened so far?

This setup is the base for any other program with graphic output.

So far you have learned, how to install Rust and initialize a new Rust project with cargo. You know what a cargo manifest is, and you can add dependencies. You have learned how to declare mutable and immutable variables and how to write functions. You can know use two different types of loops and can iterate over something. You got to know Rust's awesome error messages. You know what an enum is and can use `match` for control flow. You can look things up in the documentation. You made your first experience in handling errors and took the first step to write a multithreaded program. 

Awesome!!!!
