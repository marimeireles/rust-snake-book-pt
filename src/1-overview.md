# Learning Rust by Coding a Game of Snake

## [snake.rustbridge.com](https://snake.rustbridge.com/)

In this tutorial you will write a very simple game engine for a snake game, while learning the basics of Rust. You can also use and adapt the game engine to write any other old school pixely 2D game.

This tutorial is still in beta. If you find typos or error or have ideas for improvement, please file an issue or a pull request at [Rusty-Snake-Book](https://github.com/rustbridge/Rusty-Snake-Book)
