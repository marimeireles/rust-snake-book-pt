# How to Continue from Here

Congratulations, if you made it this far!

You don't have a running snake game yet, but you learned almost everything you need to know to continue on your own.

## Things you can do to continue with the game:

Implement
* a function that clears the grid, so the moving square does not leave a trace.

* a function that deals with the square moving out of the canvas by either

  *  wrapping (the square moves out of the canvas on one side then enters it on the other side again) or

  *  restarting the game.

* the snack for the snake.

* the snake growing when eating the snack.

* the snake biting itself leading to a restart of the game.

## Things you can do to continue in the future:

* Form a regular study group!

* Go to a local Rust MeetUp to get help or learn new things.

* Check out the book [The Rust Programming Language](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/) to learn more and get a deeper and systematic understanding of the language.

* Check out [Rust by Example](https://doc.rust-lang.org/rust-by-example/) that illustrates various Rust concepts with running code examples.

* Do [Rustlings](https://github.com/rust-lang/rustlings) exercises.

* Become a RustBridge Teaching Assistant the next time! You don't need to understand everything and you can learn so much when you're explaining things to others.
